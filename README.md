# rv-funtakes

Little app for experimenting with RVing numbers based on the paper "A Perceptual Channel for Information Transfer over Kilometer Distances: Historical Perspective and Recent Research" (Appendix A) by Harold E. Puthoff and Russel Targ. The paper can be found [here](http://espresearch.com/espgeneral/Remote-Viewing-IEEE-1976.pdf).
